# Skill Registry

> Reference for the agent and navigate's orchestrate mode. Maps intents to skills, disambiguates confusable pairs, and provides workflow templates. The agent reads this on demand for deep disambiguation; navigate uses it when composing multi-phase workflows.

## Disambiguation: Commonly Confused Skills

### icp-research vs. market-research
- **icp-research:** YOUR audience — personas, pain points, VoC quotes, habitats
- **market-research:** THE market — competitors, sizing, trends, whitespace
- **Rule:** "Who are we selling to?" → icp-research. "What does the market look like?" → market-research.
- **Both needed?** Yes — they run in parallel and feed independently into solution-design.

### copywriting vs. content-create
- **copywriting:** CRAFT quality — headlines, hooks, CTAs with rubric scoring and annotations
- **content-create:** ASSET production — full carousel, thread, email, blog in platform-native format
- **Rule:** Polished headline → copywriting. Complete LinkedIn carousel → content-create.
- **Together:** content-create often calls copywriting internally for key lines.

### discover vs. system-architecture vs. task-breakdown
- **discover:** Clarify WHAT to build (conversational discovery, optionally saves spec.md)
- **system-architecture:** Design HOW to build it (tech stack, schema, API → system-architecture.md)
- **task-breakdown:** Decompose into STEPS (granular tasks with acceptance criteria → tasks.md)
- **Rule:** Unclear idea → discover (conversation) → system-architecture → task-breakdown. Or if it's simple: discover → build directly.
- **discover is interactive** — asks questions conversationally during the session.

### solution-design vs. funnel-planner vs. experiment
- **solution-design:** WHAT initiatives to pursue (ICE scoring, prioritization)
- **funnel-planner:** WHAT numbers to hit (backward from revenue to traffic)
- **experiment:** HOW to validate before committing (A/B, pilot, cohort)
- **Rule:** solution-design picks the bets → funnel-planner sets the targets → experiment tests the bets.

### lp-optimization vs. copywriting (for landing pages)
- **lp-optimization:** AUDIT an existing page for conversion problems (hero, CTA, trust, UX)
- **copywriting:** WRITE new landing page copy from scratch
- **Rule:** Page exists and underperforms → lp-optimization. Building a new page → copywriting.

### humanize vs. copywriting
- **humanize:** POLISH existing text — strip AI patterns, inject voice, compress
- **copywriting:** WRITE new text from scratch with craft quality
- **Rule:** Text already written but sounds robotic → humanize. Need new copy → copywriting.

### attribution vs. funnel-planner
- **attribution:** MEASURE what marketing is working (map activities to outcomes)
- **funnel-planner:** SET targets (model funnel stages, define success metrics)
- **Rule:** "What should our conversion targets be?" → funnel-planner. "Which channels are driving conversions?" → attribution.

### agent-room debate vs. agent-room poll
- **debate:** Agents READ each other's responses and ARGUE across rounds. Produces convergence through disagreement.
- **poll:** Agents work INDEPENDENTLY with varied framings. Produces consensus through aggregation.
- **Rule:** Trade-off decision with no clear answer → debate. Need to filter hallucinations / find the mode → poll.

### review-chain vs. code-cleanup
- **review-chain:** CHECK quality — spawn a fresh-eyes reviewer, then resolve issues found. Does not restructure.
- **code-cleanup:** RESTRUCTURE code — refactor for readability, remove dead code, simplify. Changes structure.
- **Rule:** "Is this code correct?" → review-chain. "Make this code cleaner." → code-cleanup.
- **Together:** code-cleanup first (restructure), then review-chain (verify the restructuring didn't break anything).

## Parallel Track Mappings

Skills that can run simultaneously (no shared dependencies):

| Parallel Pair | Why Parallel | Common Phase |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| `market-research` + `problem-analysis` | Both consume `product-context.md` independently, both feed `solution-design` | Research |
| `brand-system` + `imc-plan` | Both consume `product-context.md` + `icp-research.md`, no dependency on each other | Planning |
| `brand-system` + `funnel-planner` | Both consume `solution-design.md`, no dependency on each other | Planning |
| `lp-optimization` + `seo` | Both audit the same assets from different angles (conversion vs. search) | Optimization |
| `code-cleanup` + `technical-writer` | Both are standalone horizontal skills, no shared artifacts | Quality |
| `icp-research` + `market-research` | Both are entry-point research skills with no shared dependencies | Foundation |

These mappings are encoded in each skill's `routing.parallel-with` frontmatter field and should be used by navigate when constructing workflow phases.

## Dependency Graph (Canonical)

Artifacts are optional save-points, not mandatory gates. Conversation context from the current session is equally valid as a file on disk.

```
product-context.md ← /icp-research
├→ market-research.md ← /market-research ─┐
├→ problem-analysis.md ← /problem-analysis ┤
│                                           ├→ solution-design.md ← /solution-design
│                                           │   ├→ targets.md ← /funnel-planner → experiment-*.md
│                                           │   ├→ mkt/imc-plan.md ← /imc-plan → mkt/content/ → mkt/*.humanized.md
│                                           │   └→ system-architecture.md ← /system-architecture
│                                           │       └→ tasks.md ← /task-breakdown
│                                           │           └→ (execute) → review-chain → /ship → /deploy-verify
├→ /discover (conversation context or spec.md) ──→┘
├→ design/brand-system.md ← /brand-system
└→ design/user-flow.md ← /user-flow ──→ system-architecture.md, tasks.md
```

Horizontal skills (copywriting, lp-optimization, seo, humanize, attribution, code-cleanup, technical-writer, agent-room) can be called at any point — they read upstream artifacts but don't block downstream skills.

> **Note:** review-chain is horizontal in general use but acts as a **gate for /ship** — ship consumes `meta/review-chain-report.md` as its review prerequisite. When ship is in the workflow, review-chain is a dependency, not optional.

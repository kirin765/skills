# Task Breakdown — Orchestrator

*Productivity — Multi-agent orchestration. Break architecture into executable tasks and build them one at a time with AI agents.*

**Core Question:** "Can an engineer pick up any single task and ship it independently?"

## Inputs Required
- Architecture document, feature spec, or problem description to decompose
- Target scope (MVP, full feature, spike)

## Output
- `.agents/tasks.md`

## Chain Position
Previous: `system-architecture`, `discover`, or conversation context | Next: task execution (Phase 2)

**Re-run triggers:** When architecture changes after initial breakdown, when scope mode changes (e.g., full → minimal), or when tasks consistently fail acceptance criteria (indicates decomposition issues).

## Context Resolution

Task-breakdown works from whatever context is available. It does NOT require artifacts on disk — conversation context from the current session is equally valid.

**Resolution order:**
1. **Conversation context** — if discover or system-architecture ran in this session, their decisions are in context
2. **Artifacts on disk** — `.agents/system-architecture.md`, `.agents/spec.md`, `.agents/design/user-flow.md`
3. **Defer to discover** — if neither exists, recommend running `/discover` first. Do not conduct your own interview — clarification is discover's job.

If artifacts exist but their `date` fields are older than 30 days, recommend re-running the source skill. Tip: `/navigate status` gives a single-pass freshness report across all upstream artifacts.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

### Agent Roster

| Agent | File | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| decomposer-agent | `agents/decomposer-agent.md` | Splits features into atomic, right-sized tasks |
| dependency-mapper-agent | `agents/dependency-mapper-agent.md` | Maps dependency graph, finds hidden dependencies |
| ordering-agent | `agents/ordering-agent.md` | Merges tasks + deps into risk-first ordered list |
| acceptance-agent | `agents/acceptance-agent.md` | Writes precise, verifiable acceptance criteria |
| critic-agent | `agents/critic-agent.md` | Quality gate review, sizing check, coverage trace |

### Execution Layers

```
Layer 1 (parallel):
  decomposer-agent ────────┐
  dependency-mapper-agent ──┘── run simultaneously

Layer 2 (sequential):
  ordering-agent ──────────── merges task list + dependency graph
    → acceptance-agent ────── writes criteria for ordered tasks
      → critic-agent ─────── final quality review
```

### Dispatch Protocol

1. **Confirm scope mode** — ask the user: "Are we decomposing everything (FULL), building exactly what's spec'd (LOCKED), or cutting to minimum (MINIMAL)?" Default to LOCKED if finished spec provided, MINIMAL if MVP mentioned.
2. **Extract durable decisions** — before decomposing, identify and list the architectural decisions that every task will reference: route structures, database schema shape, key data models, auth approach, third-party service boundaries, deployment target. Write these as a "Shared Context" header in the task artifact so every task can reference them without repeating or diverging. If system-architecture.md exists, extract from there. If not, extract from conversation context.
3. **Layer 1 dispatch** — send brief + scope mode + shared context to `decomposer-agent` and `dependency-mapper-agent` in parallel.
4. **Layer 2 sequential chain** — pass both outputs to `ordering-agent`, then ordered list to `acceptance-agent`, then complete breakdown to `critic-agent`.
5. **Revision loop** — if critic returns FAIL, re-dispatch affected agents with feedback. Maximum 2 rounds.
6. **Assembly** — merge into the task artifact format. Save to `.agents/tasks.md`.

### Routing Rules

| Condition | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| Scope mode MINIMAL | decomposer-agent actively cuts features before decomposing |
| Scope mode FULL | decomposer-agent captures everything; defer cuts to after |
| Scope mode LOCKED | decomposer-agent follows spec exactly; flags gaps but doesn't add |
| Critic PASS | Assemble and deliver |
| Critic FAIL | Re-dispatch cited agents with feedback |
| Revision round > 2 | Deliver with critic's remaining issues noted |

---

## Critical Gates

Before delivering, the critic-agent verifies ALL of these pass:

- [ ] Every task has exactly ONE acceptance test
- [ ] No task depends on something not yet defined
- [ ] Risky/uncertain work is front-loaded
- [ ] All external config is in Prerequisites, not buried in tasks
- [ ] A junior dev could verify each acceptance criterion
- [ ] No task requires unstated knowledge to complete
- [ ] Tasks are vertical slices (each delivers a testable increment through all layers). Horizontal-only tasks require explicit justification.

**If any gate fails:** the critic identifies which agent must fix it and the orchestrator re-dispatches with specific feedback.

---

## Single-Agent Fallback

When context window is constrained or the decomposition is simple (fewer than 10 tasks expected):

1. Skip multi-agent dispatch
2. Confirm scope mode with the user
3. Decompose using the Task Format and Sizing Rules below
4. Map dependencies inline
5. Order risk-first
6. Write acceptance criteria for each task
7. Run the Critical Gates checklist as self-review
8. Save to `.agents/tasks.md`

---

## Scope Modes

| Mode | When | Behavior |
|------|------|----------|
| **FULL SCOPE** | Discovery, greenfield, "what would it take?" | Capture everything — defer cuts to after decomposition |
| **LOCKED SCOPE** | Spec is final, ready to build | Decompose exactly what's written — flag gaps but don't add |
| **MINIMAL SCOPE** | Too much on the plate, need an MVP | Actively cut before decomposing — ask "can we ship without this?" for each feature |

Default to LOCKED SCOPE if the user provides a finished spec. Default to MINIMAL SCOPE if the user mentions MVP, prototype, or time pressure.

## Task Format

```markdown
---
skill: task-breakdown
version: 1
date: {{today}}
status: draft
---

## Task [N]: [Title]

**Depends on:** [Task numbers this requires, or "None"]

**Outcome:** [What exists when done - one sentence]

**Why:** [What this unblocks]

**Acceptance:** [How to verify - specific test, expected result]

**Autonomy:** AFK | HITL
**Why HITL:** [only if HITL — what specific judgment is needed]

**Human action:** [External setup needed, if any]
```

### Sizing Rules

Right size:
- Changes ONE testable thing
- 5-30 min agent implementation time
- Failure cause is obvious and isolated

Split if:
- Multiple independent things to test
- Multiple files for different reasons
- Acceptance has multiple unrelated conditions

### Autonomy Classification

Every task gets an **Autonomy** label:

| Label | Meaning | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **AFK** | Agent can execute end-to-end without human judgment | Deterministic tasks: scaffolding, CRUD, tests, migrations with clear schema |
| **HITL** | Needs human judgment during execution | Taste decisions, external approvals, ambiguous acceptance criteria, security-sensitive changes |

**Default to AFK.** Only mark HITL when the task genuinely requires a judgment call that the agent can't make from the spec alone. Every HITL task must state *what specific judgment* is needed — "needs review" is not sufficient.

**Why this matters:** Orchestrators (navigate, multi-agent systems) use this to batch-run AFK tasks autonomously and queue HITL tasks for user attention. Mislabeling AFK as HITL wastes the user's time. Mislabeling HITL as AFK risks wrong decisions.

### Content Rules

**Outcomes, not implementation.**

Bad: "Create users table with id, email, created_at using Prisma"
Good: "Database stores user records with unique emails and timestamps"

**Risk-first ordering.**
Put uncertain/complex tasks early. Fail fast on hard problems.

**Dependencies explicit.**
Every task lists what it needs. Enables parallel work and failure impact analysis.

---

## Phase 2: Task Execution

### Before Starting

1. Read architecture doc fully
2. Read task list fully
3. Understand the end state before writing code
4. If anything is ambiguous, ask — assumptions cause rework.

### Per-Task Protocol

1. State which task you're starting
2. Write minimum code to pass acceptance
3. State exactly what to test and expected result
4. **AFK tasks:** Run the acceptance test. Pass → commit and move to the next task without waiting. Fail → fix and re-test (max 2 attempts, then flag to user).
5. **HITL tasks:** Stop and present the result. Wait for user confirmation. Pass → commit, announce next task. Fail → fix the specific issue only, don't expand scope.

### Coding Rules

**Do:**
- Write absolute minimum code required
- Focus only on current task
- Keep code modular and testable
- Preserve existing functionality

**Avoid — these cause scope creep and breakage:**
- Sweeping changes across unrelated files
- Touching unrelated code
- Refactoring unless the task requires it
- Adding features not in the current task
- Premature optimization

**When human action is needed:**
- State exactly what to do and which file/value to update
- Wait for confirmation before continuing

### When Stuck

0. It is better to stop and say "I'm stuck — here's what I've tried" than to keep attempting fixes that aren't working. Bad work is worse than no work.
1. State what's blocking
2. Propose smallest modification to unblock
3. Wait for approval

### Scope Change Protocol

If you discover a missing requirement:

1. Stop current task
2. State what's missing and why it's needed
3. Propose where it fits in task order
4. Wait for PM to update task list
5. Resume only after task list is updated

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | INSTEAD |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| "Build the auth system" | 5+ tasks disguised as one | decomposer-agent splits into registration, login, middleware, reset, verification |
| "Create the Button component" | Not independently testable | Combine with click handling and visual states |
| Hidden dependency | Task 8 needs API key not mentioned until Task 8 | dependency-mapper-agent surfaces it; goes in Prerequisites |
| "User flow works correctly" | Vague acceptance — means different things to everyone | acceptance-agent writes specific action + input + expected result |
| Implementation-as-outcome | "Use Redux for state management" dictates HOW | decomposer-agent writes WHAT: "User data fetches efficiently with caching" |
| Saving integrations for the end | Integration issues discovered late cause the most rework | ordering-agent front-loads risky integration work |

---

## Worked Example

**User:** "Break down a Todo app with Supabase auth and email notifications."

**Orchestrator confirms:** LOCKED SCOPE (spec is clear).

**Layer 1 dispatch (parallel):**
- `decomposer-agent` → produces 7 tasks: scaffold, signup, login + protected routes, tasks table + RLS, create task, email notification, end-to-end test
- `dependency-mapper-agent` → identifies fan-out from scaffold (signup, login, tasks table are parallel), fan-in at create task (needs auth + schema), hidden dep: Resend API key missing from prerequisites

**Layer 2 chain:**
- `ordering-agent` → merges: moves Resend API key to Prerequisites, orders risk-first (auth before CRUD), identifies parallelism (signup and tasks table can run simultaneously)
- `acceptance-agent` → writes: "Submit signup form → user appears in Supabase Auth → confirmation email sent" for Task 2
- `critic-agent` → PASS, all 6 gates pass

**Artifact saved to `.agents/tasks.md`.**

---

## PM Feedback Format

When reporting test results:

```
Task [N]: PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED

[If FAIL]: What broke, error message, steps to reproduce
[If BLOCKED]: What's preventing test
```

---

## Artifact Template

On re-run: rename existing artifact to `tasks.v[N].md` and create new with incremented version.

Save to `.agents/tasks.md` using the Task Format above.

---

## Next Step

Tasks are ready. Begin implementation of the first unblocked task. Run `review-chain` after each major task completion. Run `ship` when all tasks are done.
